# Hey Jonas!
You've used great aprouches on your application.  
If I understood correctly, your application it's about movies and, of corse, you will apply others compoents to display details.

### My considerations
- You must orgnize your project in a `/src` folder, and inside it, you must create a folder for each component.
- You must use a `index.js` file to export all components, and import them in the `App.js` file.
- You must use a `styles.js` file to export all styles, and import them in the component file.
- You must move your `/assets` folder to the `/src` folder to divide the contexts about the application in general and about the app functions.
> Under `/assets` on the main folder, you must keep only the assets like icons, splash screens, background images, etc.
- Please, apply some focus on your app hidentation. It's very important to keep the code clean and readable.
> Use Ctrl + Shift + F to format your code.

### What I want for your application
[ ] Use any data storage on your application. You can save something like the user content preferences. 
> We have three simple ways to do it, and you will find the way to use it on the digital content:
> 1. Using the key-value model with AsyncStorage (3rd theme - 1st topic)
> 2. Using a relational database with SQLite (3rd theme - 2nd topic)
> 3. Using the Realm Database (3rd theme - 3rd topic)
[ ] Get from an API some movies details.
> There exist many APIs to get the movies details.
> You will find a support content to consume an API on the 4th theme of the digital content.

That's all, mate! Those points are my requirements for your next delivery (and as I know, you can do it). Keep it up!
I want to see your progress in the next steps! You're doing a great job!  

You can send me it all on the 1st of December, 2022.
